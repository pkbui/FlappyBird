# Flappy Bird

An application that mimics the Flappy Bird game in mobile.

# How to play 

The objective of this game is to control the bird traversing as far as possible. The further the bird gets, the higher score you acheive.

The bird can only move in horizontal direction.

Users need to press the 'UP' key to elevate the bird's height.

There will appear obstacles along the way which are pipes of different size.

Each pipe contains a free space for the bird to fly through.

The game ends when the bird hits the pipe.
